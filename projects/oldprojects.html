    Here you'll find a list of early games/experiments I've made that aren't worth any attention, but I wanted to put them up here anyway for the sake of history. Each links to a either the source or an executable. Most of these were made in Game Maker a long time ago (except the first 3, those were made in XNA).<br /><br />
    
	Note: These projects are not a representation of my current game dev/design abilities. Most of these are pretty bad... but that's probably because I made most of these when I was 11 or 12.<br/><br/>
	
    <table border=1 bordercolor="#404040">
    <tr><td><a href="https://github.com/TadCordle/MrGuyXNA">Mr. Guy</a></td><td>An attempt at making a flexible engine in XNA. Unfortunately I made some choices that made supporting this quite difficult, and I stopped working on it.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://github.com/TadCordle/Speedrunners-Paradise">Speedrunner's Paradise</a></td><td>A 2D platformer focusing on routing/beating levels fast. It had some pretty interesting technical features, like a replay recorder and online leaderboards (which were taken down), but ultimately had a **lot** of poor level + game design choices.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://github.com/TadCordle/Cat-Planet-2">Cat Planet 2</a></td><td>The game I made to learn how to use XNA. Not actually terrible, aside from some frame hitches when switching screens. Inspired by <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2009/12/13/cat-planet-done/">Cat Planet</a>.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><a href="https://github.com/TadCordle/tadcordle.github.io/releases/download/0.1/cog2.exe">Cog 2</a></td><td>Literally nothing like the first game. Has a pretty cringey story too.</td></tr>
