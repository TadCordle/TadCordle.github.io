    Sensorium is an open-world puzzle game in which you solve puzzles that revolve around the 5 senses: touch, taste, sight, smell, and hearing. Staying true to the Myst-vania genre, nothing in the game is outright explained to you; a big part of the game is about exploring, learning, and piecing together clues about what's going on and how everything works. <br/><br/>

The gameplay is simple and consistent without being dumbed-down. Despite the main game mechanics being fairly different from one another, you'll always know exactly what you can interact with and when. (i.e. no pixel hunting, which is a problem that plagues many adventure games!) <br /><br/>

Inspirations include Myst, The Witness, Portal, and Antichamber. I'm a big fan of games that present their stories and themes through gameplay and the environment rather than through cutscenes or long-winded text. Sensorium will have some central themes, but it will probably not have a traditional story (at least not a clear-cut one). <br/><br/>

The game is being built in Unreal Engine 4.<br/><br/>
